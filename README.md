## Getting started
**I created a cloned copy of [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L_0FI7IOwQ) homepage. The main aim is use this project to learn basics of HTML/CSS.**

I used the browserâ€™s developer tools to inspect the youtube website to understand how elements are placed and styled.
I built my own page in a .html text file and opened it in our browser to check it out. I carried out the following steps:
  - First setup a github repository for the project.
  - Then create a .html file where all our HTML markup will go
  - Create a .css file where all our styling code will reside
  - Then open the [web page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5L_0FI7IOwQ), inspect its features with browser's developer tools and start creating  :shipit:
